# Instant payment notification.

A notification is a callback. A gateway can send it back to us to let us know about changes.
It could be [Paypal Instant Payment Notification (IPN)](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/products/instant-payment-notification/) or [Payex Transaction Callback](http://www.payexpim.com/quick-guide/9-transaction-callback/) for example.
Here in this chapter we show you how to store it somewhere and process it later (with a cron script for example).

The diagram shows two examples where notification could be very handy:

## Preparations

First we have to create a model where we would store all the info:

```php
<?php
class Notification extends \ArrayObject
{
}
```

Then we have to do our notification action which would actually do all the job:

```php
<?php
use Payum\Core\Action\GatewayAwareAction;
use Payum\Core\Request\Notify;

class StoreNotificationAction extends GatewayAwareAction
{
    protected $notificationStorage;

    public function __constructor(StorageInterface $notificationStorage)
    {
        $this->notificationStorage = $notificationStorage;
    }

    public function execute($request)
    {
        $notification = $this->notificationStorage->create();

        $this->gateway->execute($getHttpRequest = new GetHttpRequest);
        foreach ($getHttpRequest->query as $name => $value) {
            $notification[$name] => $value;
        }
        foreach ($getHttpRequest->request as $name => $value) {
            $notification[$name] => $value;
        }

        $this->notificationStorage->update($notification);
    }

    public function supports($request)
    {
        return $request instanceof Notify;
    }
}
```

In the code above we created payum custom action.
The main purpose of the action to store notification that with a request.
To do so it requires a storage.
Now we can update `config.php` described in [get it started](get-it-started.md).

```php
<?php
//config.php

use Payum\Core\Extension\StorageExtension;
use Payum\Core\Storage\FilesystemStorage;

$storeNotificationAction = new StoreNotificationAction(
    new FilesystemStorage('/path/to/storage', 'Notification')
);

$payum->getGateway('paypal')->addAction($storeNotificationAction);
```

Now we have to implement `notify.php` script which must be accessible from the internet.

```php
<?php
//notify.php

use Payum\Core\Request\Notify;

include 'config.php';

$token = $requestVerifier->verify();
$gateway = $payum->getGateway($token->getGatewayName());

$gateway->execute(new Notify($token));
```

## Setup Paypal IPN.

The code above could be reused with any other gateway.
Now I want to show changes need to enable Paypal IPN. To do so we have to modify `prepare.php` a bit:

```php
<?php
// prepare.php

$notifyToken = $tokenFactory->createNotifyToken('paypal', $paymentDetails);

$paymentDetails['NOTIFYURL'] = $notifyToken->getTargetUrl();

$storage->update($paymentDetails);
```

Here we created one more token: `notify` and tell paypal to use its target url for notifications.
